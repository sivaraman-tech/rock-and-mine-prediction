📘 Project: Rock and Mine Prediction
🔍 Overview

This project predicts whether a given object is a rock or a mine based on sonar signal data. Using Machine Learning classification techniques, the model learns patterns from sonar readings and classifies new inputs accurately.

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python 🐍

Google Colab

NumPy, Pandas (data processing)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)

Scikit-learn (model building and evaluation)

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains sonar signal returns measured from objects at different angles.

Each entry represents a set of features (frequencies) and the target label (Rock or Mine).

🚀 Steps in the Project

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature selection & scaling

Model training using classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, etc.)

Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

Prediction for new sonar readings

🎯 Results

The trained model successfully distinguishes between rock and mine objects with good accuracy.

Can be extended for real-world defense & underwater navigation applications.
